The **Arena Breakout: Infinite Radar Vision Tool** is crafted for players who want unmatched battlefield awareness. By projecting a real-time radar overlay, it reveals the locations of enemies, loot containers, and objectives—removing guesswork and giving you a tactical edge in every raid.

## 📖 Overview

Arena Breakout: Infinite thrives on tension—dark corners, sudden ambushes, and limited intel. But for players who want to refine strategy or experiment with raid routes, the Radar Vision Tool makes it possible to see **everything in motion**, from enemy squads to extraction points.

[!WARNING]
Use strictly for **offline/custom play**. Enabling radar in competitive servers risks bans.
